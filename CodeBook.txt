DATA DICTIONARY - GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

The tidy data set provided consists of the following 81 variables. The first 79 variables consist of means and standard deviations of the variables indicated.

The different data files were merged into a single file according to its dimensions.

Activities were labelled as: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.

Subjects remain identified by code (1-30).

Only variables referring to mean ("mean") and standard deviation ("std") were selected.

Activity names were modified so as to agree with labelling conventions, resulting in the following 79 variable names:
